Let the yeast proof for about 5 minutes, until the mixture looks nice and foamy. Add kosher salt to bowl. Add flour to bowl a bit at a time and mix on low speed until all flour is incorporated and dough has just started to pull away from the sides of the bowl.

Saturday Evening: Make the dough, and let rise overnight. Sunday Morning: Shape the dough, let rise again, score, and bake. MAKE THE DOUGH In the evening, whisk the starter and water together in a large bowl with a fork. Add the flour and salt. Combine until a stiff dough forms, then finish mixing by hand to fully incorporate the flour. The dough will feel dense and shaggy, and it will stick to your fingers as you go. Scrape out as much as you can. Cover with a damp towel and let rest for 30 minutes. Replenish your starter with fresh flour and water, and store according to preference. After the dough has rested, work the mass into a fairly smooth ball. To do this, grab a portion of the dough and fold it over, pressing your fingertips into the center. Repeat, working your way around the dough until it begins to tighten, about 15 seconds. BULK RISE Cover the bowl with a damp towel and let rise overnight at room temperature. This will take about 8 to 10 hours at 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C). The dough is ready when it no longer looks dense and has doubled in size. SHAPE In the morning, coax the dough onto a lightly floured work surface. To shape it into a round, start at the top and fold the dough over toward the center. Turn the dough slightly and fold over the next section of dough. Repeat until you have come full circle. Flip the dough over and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, line an 8-inch (20-cm) bowl with a towel and dust with flour. With floured hands, gently cup the dough and pull it toward you in a circular motion to tighten its shape. Using a bench scraper, place the dough into the bowl, seam side up. SECOND RISE Cover the bowl and let rest for 30 minutes to 1 hour. The dough is ready when it looks puffy and has risen slightly but has not yet doubled in size. Preheat your oven to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C). Cut a sheet of parchment paper to t the size of your baking pot, leaving enough excess around the sides to remove the bread. SCORE Place the parchment over the dough and invert the bowl to release. Sprinkle the dough with flour and gently rub the surface with your hands. Using the tip of a small, serrated knife or a razor blade, score the dough with the cross-cut pattern on page 195, or any way you\u2019d like. Use the parchment to transfer the dough to the baking pot. BAKE Bake the dough on the center rack for 20 minutes, covered. Remove the lid, and continue to bake for 30 minutes. Then, carefully remove the loaf from the pot and bake directly on the oven rack for the last 10 minutes to crisp the crust. When finished, transfer to a wire rack. Cool for 1 hour before slicing. Sourdough is best consumed on the same day it is baked. To maximize freshness, cool completely and store at room temperature in a plastic bag for up to 1 day.","title":"No Knead Everyday Sourdough Bread"},{"location":"cookbook/baking/bread/no-knead-everyday-sourdough-bread/#preparation-time-and-yield","text":"Prep Time 12-14 hours Cook Time 50 minutes Total Time 15 hours Servings 1 loaf","title":"Preparation Time and Yield"},{"location":"cookbook/baking/bread/no-knead-everyday-sourdough-bread/#ingredients","text":"50 g (1\u20444 cup) bubbly, active starter 350 g (11\u20443 cups plus 2 tbsp) warm water 500 g (4 cups plus 2 tbsp) bread flour 9 g (11\u20442 tsp) fine sea salt","title":"Ingredients"},{"location":"cookbook/baking/bread/no-knead-everyday-sourdough-bread/#method","text":"","title":"Method"},{"location":"cookbook/baking/bread/no-knead-everyday-sourdough-bread/#bakers-schedule","text":"Thursday\u2013Saturday: Feed your starter until bubbly and active.

Add the sugar and salt, and whisk to combine. Place a lightly oiled skillet over medium heat, or preheat a griddle to 180\u00b0C (360\u00b0F). Grease crumpet rings well, if using, and place on the skillet to preheat. When the skillet and rings are hot, add the baking soda to the batter and whisk it in. As the baking soda reacts to the acid in the starter, the batter will quickly start to foam and rise. Using a measuring cup, a small ladle, or an ice cream scoop, pour about 60 ml (1/4 cup) of the batter into each crumpet ring, or directly onto the skillet if you're not using rings. Cook for a few minutes, until the top is set; exact timing will depend on your stove, your skillet, and the thickness of your crumpets. (If your stove has hot spots -- and I don't mean the wifi type -- you may have to rotate the skillet every once in a while, and rotate each crumpet after a few minutes so they brown evenly.) As they cook, the crumpets will gradually shrink back from the rings. Using tongs, lift the crumpet rings off the crumpets (wriggle them loose and/or use a knife to help loosen the crumpets if they stick a bit), and optionally (this is not traditional but I prefer them that way), flip the crumpets to brown lightly on the other side. Transfer to a rack to cool completely. Wipe down the crumpet rings if necessary, re-grease, and place them on the skillet to preheat again before repeating with the remaining batter. (When you're done with the crumpet rings, handwash and dry them thoroughly so they won't rust.) Crumpets should be toasted before eating. The crumpets can also be frozen once cooled: freeze them in a single layer on a cookie sheet before putting them in a freezer bag so they won't clump. You can pop them in the toaster straight from the freezer. Notes A \"100%\" starter is fed an equal weight of flour and water at every feeding. To learn more about starters, please refer to my post on natural starter bread. If you have more starter to use up, mix the batter in 1-cup batches anyway, as written. The batter cooks best just after the addition of the baking soda, so a larger amount won't yield as good a result. Adapted from instructions found on the King Arthur Flour website.","title":"Sourdough Crumpets with Natural Starter"},{"location":"cookbook/baking/buns-and-rolls/sourdough-crumpets-with-natural-starter/#preparation-time-and-yield","text":"Prep Time 10 minutes Cook Time 10 minutes Total Time 30 minutes Servings 8 9-cm crumpets","title":"Preparation Time and Yield"},{"location":"cookbook/baking/buns-and-rolls/sourdough-crumpets-with-natural-starter/#ingredients","text":"270 g natual starter 1 teaspoon sugar 1/2 teaspoon sea salt 1/2 teaspoon baking soda vegetable oil for greasing","title":"Ingredients"},{"location":"cookbook/baking/buns-and-rolls/sourdough-crumpets-with-natural-starter/#method","text":"Place the starter in a large bowl, about 1 liter (1 quart) in capacity.

The batter cooks best just after the addition of the baking soda, so a larger amount won't yield as good a result.

Line the bottoms of three 8-inch round cake pans with a circle of parchment paper, and spray the pans with nonstick spray. Set aside. In a large bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder and salt together. In a small saucepan, bring the milk and butter to a boil. Once boiling, immediately remove from the heat and add the vanilla extract and almond extract. In a separate bowl, using a hand mixer or stand mixer, beat the eggs and sugar until pale yellow, fluffy, and doubled in volume. This takes about 5 minutes - do not skip this step, this helps to make the cake fluffy. While still beating, slowly drizzle in the hot milk mixture. Beat in the flour mixture. Divide the batter between the prepared pans (I use a generous 2 cups of batter per pan). Bake for 14-18 minutes, or until the edges are light golden, the center springs back when lightly pressed, and a cake tester comes out clean. I recommend rotating the baking pans at least once during cook time. Set the pans on a rack to cool. Run the tip of a sharp knife around the edges of the cakes to loosen them, and turn them out of the pans (the layers will be fairly thin, about 1-inch high). Filling and topping Combine the strawberries and jam and set aside (these will be used for the filling and topping). Note: I sliced the strawberries for the filling (about 2 1/2 cups), and I diced the strawberries for the top of the cake (about 1/2 cup). Do both, or one or the other - your choice. You'll need about 3 cups total. For the whipped cream frosting: Combine the cream cheese, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract in a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Fit the mixer with the whisk attachment and mix on medium speed until smooth. While the mixture is still whipping, slowly pour in the heavy cream down the side of the bowl. Stop and scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl periodically. Increase the speed and continue whipping until the cream can hold a stiff peak. Assembly: Place one layer of cake on a platter. Top with whipped cream frosting, then top with about 1 1/4 cups of sliced/diced strawberries. Place another layer of cake on top and repeat. For the third/top of layer of cake, top with whipped cream frosting, then place the remaining diced/sliced strawberries in the center. Decorate the outside with whole strawberries, if desired. I like to store this cake in the fridge to keep the frosting stable. Notes There will be enough whipped cream frosting to coat the sides of the cake, if you desire. I chose to leave the sides exposed.
