<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
	<li>270 g natual starter</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon sea salt</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
	<li>vegetable oil for greasing &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="method">Method</h2>
<ol type="1">
	<li>Place the starter in a large bowl, about 1 liter (1 quart) in
	capacity. Add the sugar and salt, and whisk to combine.</li>
	<li>Place a lightly oiled skillet over medium heat, or preheat a
	griddle to 180°C (360°F). Grease crumpet rings well, if using, and
	place on the skillet to preheat.</li>
	<li>When the skillet and rings are hot, add the baking soda to the
	batter and whisk it in. As the baking soda reacts to the acid in
	the starter, the batter will quickly start to foam and rise.</li>
	<li>Using a measuring cup, a small ladle, or an ice cream scoop,
	pour about 60 ml (1/4 cup) of the batter into each crumpet ring,
	or directly onto the skillet if you’re not using rings.</li>
	<li>Cook for a few minutes, until the top is set; exact timing
	will depend on your stove, your skillet, and the thickness of your
	crumpets. (If your stove has hot spots – and I don’t mean the wifi
	type – you may have to rotate the skillet every once in a while,
	and rotate each crumpet after a few minutes so they brown evenly.)
	As they cook, the crumpets will gradually shrink back from the
	rings.</li>
	<li>Using tongs, lift the crumpet rings off the crumpets (wriggle
	them loose and/or use a knife to help loosen the crumpets if they
	stick a bit), and optionally (this is not traditional but I prefer
	them that way), flip the crumpets to brown lightly on the other
	side.</li>
	<li>Transfer to a rack to cool completely. Wipe down the crumpet
	rings if necessary, re-grease, and place them on the skillet to
	preheat again before repeating with the remaining batter. (When
	you’re done with the crumpet rings, handwash and dry them
	thoroughly so they won’t rust.)</li>
	<li>Crumpets should be toasted before eating.</li>
	<li>The crumpets can also be frozen once cooled: freeze them in a
	single layer on a cookie sheet before putting them in a freezer
	bag so they won’t clump. You can pop them in the toaster straight
	from the freezer.</li>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<ul>
	<li>A “100%” starter is fed an equal weight of flour and water at
	every feeding. To learn more about starters, please refer to my
	post on natural starter bread.</li>
	<li>If you have more starter to use up, mix the batter in 1-cup
	batches anyway, as written. The batter cooks best just after the
	addition of the baking soda, so a larger amount won’t yield as
	good a result.</li>
