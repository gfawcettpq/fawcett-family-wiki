## Preparation Time and Yield

- **Prep Time** 10 minutes
- **Cook Time** 2 hours and 50 minutes
- **Total Time** 3 hours
- **Servings** 10 servings

## Ingredients

- 1 corned beef brisket (about 4 pounds) with spice packet
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 bay leaves
- 3-1/2 pounds small potatoes (10-15), peeled
- 8 medium carrots, halved crosswise
- 1 medium head cabbage, cut into wedges

### HORSERADISH SAUCE:

- 3 tablespoons Kerrygold butter
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 to 1-1/2 cups reserved cooking juices from corned beef
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 tablespoon cider vinegar
- 1/4 cup horseradish

### MUSTARD SAUCE (optional):

- 1 cup sour cream
- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
- 1/4 teaspoon sugar

## Method

1. Place brisket, contents of seasoning packet, brown sugar and bay leaves in a large Dutch oven or stockpot; cover with water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, covered, 2 hours.
2. Add potatoes and carrots; return to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, covered, just until beef and vegetables are tender, 30-40 minutes. (If pot is full, remove potatoes and carrots before adding cabbage; reheat before serving.)
3. Add cabbage to pot; return to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, covered, until cabbage is tender, about 15 minutes. Remove vegetables and corned beef; keep warm.
4. For Horseradish Sauce, strain and reserve 1-1/2 cups cooking juices; skim fat from reserved juices. Discard remaining juices. Prepare sauces as desired.
5. Cut beef across the grain into slices. Serve with vegetables, Horseradish Sauce and, if desired, Mustard Sauce.

### Horseradish Sauce

1. In a small saucepan, melt butter over medium heat; stir in flour until smooth.
2. Gradually whisk in 1 cup reserved juices.
3. Stir in sugar, vinegar and horseradish; bring to a boil, stirring constantly.
4. Cook and stir until thickened. If desired, thin with additional juices. Season to taste with additional sugar, vinegar or horseradish.

### Mustard Sauce
