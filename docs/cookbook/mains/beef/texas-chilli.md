## Preparation Time and Yield

- **Prep Time** 20 minutes
- **Cook Time** 4 hours
- **Total Time** 4 hours, 20 minutes
- **Servings** 6 servings

## Ingredients

- 4 lbs boneless beef chuck roast trimmed of excess fat, cut into ½ inch chunks
- salt & pepper to taste
- 6 tablespoons olive oil divided
- 3 jalapeno peppers seeded and diced
- 1 large yellow onion diced
- 5 cloves garlic minced
- 1 chipotle pepper in adobo sauce seeded and finely chopped
- 1 can crushed tomatoes (28 ounces)
- 3 tablespoons tomato paste
- 4 cups beef stock or broth
- 2 bay leaves

### Seasoning Mix

- 2 tablespoons chili powde
- 2 tablespoons smoked paprika
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 1 tablespoon dried oregano
- 2 teaspoons chipotle chili powder
- 2 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

## Method

1. Season the beef with kosher salt and black pepper.
2. In a large pot, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat and brown half of the meat. Repeat with remaining beef. Remove from heat and set aside.
3. Add remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil and heat 30 seconds. Add the jalapeno peppers and onions and saute for about 10 minutes onions are softened. (Do not brown them).
4. Stir in garlic and seasoning mix and cook 30 seconds or just until fragrant.
5. Add the beef back into the pot along with remaining ingredients.
6. Bring the chili to a boil and then turn the heat down to low.
7. Simmer, uncovered, for 3 to 3-½ hours stirring occasionally so it doesn’t stick. If it becomes too thick, add more stock as needed.
8. Before serving remove the bay leaves and serve plain or covered with sour cream, shredded cheese, or green onions.
