## Preparation Time and Yield

- **Prep Time** 5 minutes
- **Cook Time** 0 minutes
- **Total Time** 5 minutes
- **Servings** 8 1 Tbsp Servings

## Ingredients

- 1/4 cup plain hummus (store-bought or DIY)
- 1 tsp spicy mustard
- 1/2 tsp lemon zest
- 2-3 Tbsp lemon juice, to taste
- 2 tsp capers (finely minced/smashed, plus 3 tsp brining juice as original recipe is written- adjust amount if altering batch size)
- 3 Tbsp fresh minced garlic (4-5 cloves yield ~3 Tbsp minced)
- 1 healthy pinch each sea salt + pepper (more to taste)
- 1-2 Tbsp olive oil (optional // for added creaminess)
- 1-2 tsp maple syrup (optional)

## Method

1. To a small mixing bowl, add hummus, spicy mustard, lemon zest + juice, minced capers + brining juice, and minced garlic, and whisk thoroughly to combine. Olive oil is optional, but will add a bit more creaminess.
2. Add a little hot water to thin until pourable and whisk until creamy and smooth (see photo). Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more salt and pepper, lemon juice, or minced garlic if desired! Maple syrup will help offset how salty and briney this dressing is, if you find you need it (I did not).
3. Use immediately, or store in the refrigerator up to 5-7 days.
