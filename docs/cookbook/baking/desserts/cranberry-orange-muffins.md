- **Prep Time** 20 minutes
- **Cook Time** 21 minutes
- **Total Time** 41 minutes
- **Servings** 12 muffins

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup milk whole milk recommended
- 1 1/2 tsp lemon juice
- 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 4 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp fine table salt
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil
- 1 1/4 cups white sugar
- 2 large eggs
- Zest of one orange about 1 Tbsp
- 1 tsp vanilla or vanilla bean paste
- 1/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
- 1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen cranberries

## Method

1. 2-3 Tbsp white sparkling sanding sugar demerara sugar, turbinado sugar or white sugar
2. Preheat oven to 425F (220C) Spray a 12 cup muffin tray with baking spray or line with paper liners. Set aside.
3. Add lemon juice to milk. Stir and let stand 5 minutes.
4. In a large bowl, whisk together well the flour, baking powder and salt.
5. \*If using frozen cranberries, do not thaw. Toss with 1 tsp flour before adding to batter. Starting with frozen cranberries will add 5-8 minutes to your baking time.
6. In a medium bowl, whisk together the milk/lemon juice, the vegetable oil, sugar, eggs, orange juice, vanilla and orange zest. Add the wet mixture to the dry ingredients, mixing just until combined and no flour is visible. Fold in the cranberries.
7. Divide the batter amongst the 10-12 muffin cups (10 for large muffins, 12 for regular muffins). Sprinkle tops generously with sugar.
8. Bake at 425F (220C) for 5 minutes, then reduce the oven temp to 375F (190C) and bake for another 13-16 minutes if you started with fresh cranberries or 18-22 minutes if you started with frozen cranberries. Bake until lightly golden and a tester inserted in the middle comes out clean.
9. Remove from oven and allow to cool in the pans. Remove from pans and store in an airtight container.
