- **Total Time** 17 minutes
- **Servings**

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup (113g) water
- 1 1/2 cups (259g) chopped dates
- 3/4 cup (149g) sugar
- 1/2 cup (8 tablespoons, 113g) unsalted butter
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3/4 cup (74g) fresh or frozen cranberries
- 1/2 cup (57g) chopped walnuts
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 large eggs
- 1 cup (227g) sourdough starter, unfed/discard
- 1 1/4 cups (149g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Grease the wells of a 12-cup muffin pan, or line with papers and grease the insides of the papers.
2. In a large saucepan, combine the water, dates, sugar, butter, and vanilla. Cook over medium heat and bring to a boil, stirring often.
3. Remove from the heat and stir in the cranberries, nuts, baking soda, salt, and eggs; mix thoroughly. Stir in the starter and the flour until evenly combined.
4. Scoop the batter by the quarter-cupful into the prepared pan. Bake the muffins for 17 to 19 minutes, until a paring knife inserted in the center of one comes out clean.
5. Remove the muffins from the oven and cool them in the pan for 5 minutes before transferring them to a rack to cool completely.
6. Store any leftover muffins, tightly wrapped in plastic, at room temperature for several days; freeze for longer storage.
