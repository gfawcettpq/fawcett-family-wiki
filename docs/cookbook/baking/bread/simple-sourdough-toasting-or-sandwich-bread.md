## Preparation Time and Yield

- **Prep Time** 6-18 hours
- **Cook Time** 45 minutes
- **Total Time** 7-19 hours
- **Servings** 1 loaf

## Ingredients

- 100 g (about 1/2 cup) active starter
- 10 g (about 2.5 teaspoons) kosher salt
- 440 g (about 1.75 cups) water, (or less, see notes above) room temperature
- 512 g (4 cups) bread flour, such as King Arthur Flour
- a few tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- room temperature butter, for greasing

## Method

1. Place the starter, salt, and water in a large bowl. Stir with a spatula to combine — it doesn’t have to be uniformly mixed. Add the flour. Mix again until the flour is completely incorporated. Drizzle with a splash of olive oil and rub to coat. Cover bowl with a tea towel or bowl cover and set aside to rise for 6 to 18 hours — if it is super hot out or if you live in a humid environment, it may only take 6 hours. When the dough has nearly doubled in volume, it is ready.
2. When the dough has nearly doubled, grease a 10 x 5-inch loaf pan with butter (or nonstick spray). Drizzle dough with a few tablespoons of olive oil. Rub your hand in the oil to coat. Use your hand to deflate the dough: pull the dough from the sides and press it into the center. Video guidance here. Turn dough over so seam-side is down and gently stretch into an oblong shape.
3. Transfer to prepared pan seam side down. Leave alone for 5 to 6 hours or until dough begins crowning the rim of the pan — this may take less time when it is very warm out. Do be patient with this second rise: to get good height, the dough should be above the rim of the pan before you transfer it to the oven.
4. Heat oven to 425ºF. Transfer pan to the oven and bake for about 20 minutes. Reduce heat to 375ºF. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes more or until golden all around. If you have an instant read thermometer, it should register 206-210ºF or so before removing. Remove pan from oven and turn bread out onto a cooling rack. Cool at least 20 minutes before slicing.
