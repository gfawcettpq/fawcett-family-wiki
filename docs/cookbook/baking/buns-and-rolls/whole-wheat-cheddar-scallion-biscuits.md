## Preparation Time and Yield

- **Prep Time** 15 minutes
- **Cook Time** 15 minutes
- **Total Time** 30 minutes
- **Servings** 8 large biscuts

## Ingredients

- 2 cups whole-wheat pastry flour
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 3/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 8 tablespoons butter, cut into 1/2 tablespoon chunks
- 2 green onions (or scallions), thinly sliced, about 1/2 cup total, white and green parts
- 3/4 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese
- 1 cup buttermilk

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, pepper, and salt. Use a pastry cutter, or your fingers, to work in the butter pieces until the mixture is crumbly.
3. Use a fork to stir in the scallions and the cheese. Stir in the buttermilk until the dough comes together (adding more buttermilk or flour, a tablespoon at a time, if necessary to help the dough come togetherâ€”dough will neither be sticky nor crumbly).
4. Transfer dough to a lightly floured cutting board and knead 3 to 4 times. Pat dough into an 8" X 6" rectangle; fold 1 short side a third of the way over the center then fold opposite short side over folded end (like a business letter fold).
5. Rotate dough clockwise 90 degrees, pat out dough, and repeat folding again. Pat out into one final 8" X 6" rectangle and cut into 8 equal rectangle pieces.
6. Place on prepared baking sheet and bake until golden brown, about 10 to 15 minutes.
