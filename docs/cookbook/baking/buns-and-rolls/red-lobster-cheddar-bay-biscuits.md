## Preparation Time and Yield

- **Prep Time** 15 minutes
- **Cook Time** 12 minutes
- **Total Time** 27 minutes
- **Servings** 12 biscuits

## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 2 teaspoons garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, optional
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
- 1 1/2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley leaves
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder

## Method

1. Preheat oven to **450 degrees F**. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat; set aside.
2. In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, garlic powder, salt and cayenne pepper, if using.
3. In a large glass measuring cup or another bowl, whisk together buttermilk and butter. Pour mixture over dry ingredients and stir using a rubber spatula just until moist. Gently fold in cheese.
4. Using a 1/4-cup measuring cup, scoop the batter evenly onto the prepared baking sheet. Place into oven and bake for **10-12 minutes**, or until golden brown.
5. For the topping, whisk together butter, parsley and garlic powder in a small bowl. Working one at a time, brush the tops of the biscuits with the butter mixture.
6. Serve immediately.
